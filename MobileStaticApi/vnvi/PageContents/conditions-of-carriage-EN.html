<p>Except as provided in <a href="#yakkan2_4">2.4</a>, <a href="#yakkan2_7">2.7</a> and <a href="#yakkan2_9">2.9</a>, these Conditions of Carriage apply wherever &ldquo;Jetstar Japan&rdquo; or our Airline Designator Code &ldquo;GK&rdquo; is shown on a Booking, and in any case where we have a legal liability to you in relation to your flight.</p>
<h4 class="c6">2.2 Gratuitous or reduced fare carriage</h4>
<p>These Conditions of Carriage also apply to gratuitous and reduced fare carriage (except to the extent that we have told you otherwise) and Frequent Flyer Award travel.</p>
<h4 class="c6">2.3 Basis of carriage</h4>
<p>The carriage of a Passenger on any flight by Jetstar Japan is subject to the followings:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Booking,</li>
<li>these Conditions of Carriage in effect at the time of the carriage,</li>
<li>the Key Conditions of Carriage in effect at the time of the carriage,</li>
<li>applicable laws which may include the laws of Japan such as the Civil Aeronautics Act, any international Conventions and court rulings, and may be subject to the jurisdiction of Japanese courts,</li>
<li>the Fare Rules filed by us with regulatory bodies,</li>
<li>any specific directions given to a Passenger in writing, or orally by Jetstar Japan staff, and</li>
<li>the Frequent Flyer Award redemption rules.</li>
</ul>
<a name="yakkan2_4"></a>
<h4 class="c6">2.4 Read Down</h4>
<p>If any of these Conditions of Carriage is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it will be deemed to be valid to the extent necessary so as not to be in conflict with applicable laws and regulations, but if that is not possible, it will be severed from the Conditions of Carriage and the other conditions will remain valid.</p>
<h4 class="c6">2.5 Variation and Waiver</h4>
<p>No employee or other person is authorised to vary any of these Conditions of Carriage.</p>
<p>Jetstar Japan may change, modify or amend any provision of these Conditions of Carriage or our regulations without prior notice; provided, however, that, no contract of carriage shall be subject to such change, modification or amendment made after the carriage pursuant to such contract commences.</p>
<h4 class="c6">2.6 Conditions prevail</h4>
<p>Subject to <a href="#yakkan2_7">2.7</a>, if any of these Conditions of Carriage is inconsistent with any special arrangements we may have, these Conditions of Carriage will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
<a name="yakkan2_7"></a>
<h4 class="c6">2.7 Overriding law</h4>
<p>These Conditions of Carriage are applicable unless they are inconsistent with any Fare Rules or laws which apply to your carriage with us, in which event the Fare Rules or laws will apply.</p>
<h4 class="c6">2.8 Charter operations</h4>
<p>If carriage is performed by Jetstar Japan under a charter agreement, these Conditions of Carriage apply unless Passengers are advised otherwise.</p>
<a name="yakkan2_9"></a>
<h4 class="c6">2.9 Other travel arrangements</h4>
<p>If Jetstar Japan transports you or arranges to transport you by means other than aircraft, eg. by bus, train or boat, or arranges accommodation or car rental, we do so only as an agent. There may be additional or different conditions of carriage applicable to those arrangements. Where these include limitations of liability that are lower than the limitations of liability in these conditions of carriage, the lower limitation will apply to your non-aircraft arrangements.</p>
<p>If we arrange travel for you on a flight with another Carrier&rsquo;s Airline Designator Code, we do so only as agent for that Carrier and the other Carrier&rsquo;s conditions of carriage will apply. (see also <a href="#yakkan14_3a">14.3(a)</a>)</p>
<h4 class="c6">2.10 Codeshares</h4>
<p>We have arrangements with other Carriers known as &rsquo;codeshares&rsquo;. This means that even if you have made a Booking with us and hold a Ticket for a Jetstar Japan flight showing &rsquo;GK&rsquo; as the Airline Designator Code, you may travel on another Carrier&rsquo;s aircraft.</p>
<p>If such arrangements apply to your flight, we will advise you of the Carrier operating the aircraft before you complete your Booking.</p>
<h4 class="c6">2.11 <strong>EC Directive - Package Travel and Holiday Tours (United Kingdom)</strong></h4>
<p>We or an Authorised Agent will, if you ask, issue a new Ticket to somebody else to replace your Ticket if:</p>
<ul>
<li>your Ticket is one to which the European Community Directive 90/314/EEC on Package Travel and Holiday Tours applies,</li>
<li>you want to transfer your booking under article 4.3 of the Directive,</li>
<li>you prove to us or an Authorised Agent that you have satisfied the requirements of Article 4.3 of the directive and are entitled to transfer the booking,</li>
<li>you give us or an Authorised Agent reasonable notice of your intention to transfer the booking before your date of departure of your flight,</li>
<li>you give us or an Authorised Agent the full name, address and contact number of the person to whom you want the new Ticket to be issued,</li>
<li>you deliver your Ticket to us or an Authorised Agent, and</li>
<li>you pay us or an Authorised Agent a reasonable administration fee for issuing the new Ticket.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3 class="c5">3. GENERAL</h3>
<a name="yakkan3_1"></a>
<h4 class="c6">3.1 Preparing to travel</h4>
<p>You alone are responsible for making all necessary arrangements for your travel and ensuring that you comply with all laws, regulations and orders of the places you will travel to. For example, you will need to find out from relevant embassies or consulates whether you need a passport, visa or other travel document, health document or evidence of onward travel or accommodation.</p>
<p>If we provide assistance or information for any of the above aspects of your travel, we do not release you from your responsibility in respect of these matters.</p>
<h4 class="c6">3.2 Destination - Passenger enquiries</h4>
<p>If you are travelling overseas, you should enquire about any local issues and conditions at your destination(s) prior to commencing travel. We may not be able to make a full and complete explanation as to the safety, conditions or other issues that may exist at any destination. Travel advice can be obtained from various sources, including local governments, local consular offices and the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the United States Department of State.</p>
<h4 class="c6">3.3 Travel Insurance</h4>
<p>Our liability to you is limited and it is recommended that you purchase travel insurance, which can cover things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes in travel plans and travel cancellation,</li>
<li>medical and hospital expenses,</li>
<li>personal injury and death,</li>
<li>delayed, damaged or lost Baggage and other items,</li>
<li>missed flight connections and additional expenses.</li>
</ul>
<a name="yakkan3_4"></a>
<h4 class="c6">3.4 Health</h4>
<p>(a) We may refuse to carry you if we, acting reasonably, are not completely satisfied that it is safe for you to fly. Before you make a Booking you should tell us if you suffer from any illness, disease or other condition which may make it unsafe for you or other Passengers if you fly.</p>
<p>(b) <b>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</b></p>
<p>Some studies have concluded that prolonged immobility may be a risk factor in the formation of blood clots in the legs (DVT - Deep Vein Thrombosis). If you feel you may be at risk from DVT or other health problems Jetstar Japan recommends you consult with your doctor before travel.</p>
<p>Information on health issues can be found on our website at jetstar.com or in our inflight magazine.</p>
<p>(c) <b>Pregnancy</b></p>
<p>If you are pregnant, the following precautions must be observed.</p>
<p><b>For travel after the first 28 weeks of your pregnancy:</b> you need to carry a certificate or letter from a registered medical practitioner or registered midwife confirming:</p>
<p>the estimated date of delivery</p>
<p>whether it is a single or multiple pregnancy; and</p>
<p>that there are no complications with your pregnancy</p>
<p><b>For flights of four hours or more:</b></p>
<p>if you are having no complications with your pregnancy you can travel up to the end of the 36th week of your pregnancy for single pregnancies or up to the end of the 32nd week for multiple pregnancies (for example, twins)</p>
<p>Medical clearance is required if you are having complications with your pregnancy.</p>
<p><b>For flights of less than four hours:</b></p>
<p>If you are having no complications with your pregnancy you can travel up to the end of the 40th week of your pregnancy for single pregnancies and up to the end of the 36th week for multiple pregnancies (for example, twins)</p>
<p>Medical clearance is required if you are having complications with your pregnancy.</p>
<p>If you wish to travel within seven days after delivery, medical clearance is required. Infants cannot travel for 48 hours after delivery and need medical clearance to travel between three and seven days after delivery.</p>
<p><b>Please Note:</b></p>
<p>We do not represent that travel is safe for you at any particular point during your pregnancy. You must seek advice from your own medical practitioner prior to your flight. The periods referred to above are only our minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Some countries place limitations on the entry of non-national pregnant women. Check with the relevant embassy or consulate before you travel to confirm any further limitations.</p>
<h4 class="c6">3.5 Privacy</h4>
<p>Jetstar Japan collects information about you (including health information where necessary) to provide products and services to you, process your travel arrangements, facilitate your participation in the loyalty programs of Jetstar Japan or other organisations, conduct marketing activities and market research and for administrative and legal purposes. If the information is not provided, Jetstar Japan may not be able to provide the service requested. In accordance with applicable laws and regulations, Jetstar Japan may retain and may disclose your personal information without your prior consent to third parties including its related companies, other carriers, travel service providers, organisations which provide services to Jetstar Japan, such as collecting commissions (more details are in our Privacy Statement on jetstar.com), your employer if you are travelling on a Booking purchased by your employer, various law enforcement agencies and governments around the world for security, customs, emergency and immigration purposes.</p>

<br>
<h3 class="c5">4. BOOKINGS</h3>
<h4 class="c6">4.1 When is a Booking made?</h4>
<p>A Booking for a flight is made when recorded as accepted and confirmed by Jetstar Japan or an Authorised Agent. If you ask, we or our Authorised Agent will give you written confirmation of your Booking. We do not accept any responsibility for any loss you may incur as a result of making arrangements for travel on Jetstar Japan through anyone other than Jetstar Japan or its Authorised Agent.</p>
<h4 class="c6">4.2 Payment essential</h4>
<p>Even if you have a Booking for a flight, if Jetstar Japan has not received your payment you will not be carried.</p>
<h4 class="c6">4.3 Reconfirmation</h4>
<p>Reconfirmation is not required for Jetstar Japan flights. However, you may need to reconfirm your reservation on any other carriers on which you intend to travel. You should check the reconfirmation requirements with those other Carriers.</p>
<h4 class="c6">4.4 Some Bookings cannot be changed</h4>
<p>Pursuant to the Fare Rules, some fare types may be restricted so that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>cannot change or cancel any Booking, or</li>
<li>may request to change or cancel a Booking, subject to a certain provision of the Fare Rules, or</li>
<li>may request to change a Booking only by paying any applicable fare difference, additional service fee or change fee (note: Jetstar Japan may revise fees from time to time. Please contact our website on jetstar.com for further details.). Only Jetstar Japan or its Authorised Agent may change or cancel a Booking.</li>
</ul>
<a name="yakkan4_5"></a>
<h4 class="c6">4.5 Specific assistance</h4>
<p>Generally we will not allow a person to travel without an Accompanying Passenger unless the person can travel independently, meaning that they can travel safely without assistance, supervision or both. We do not have the systems, staff or facilities required to assume responsibility for such assistance and supervision.</p>
<p>Children not yet 12 years of age will be regarded as requiring supervision and will not be able to travel independently on the basis that they may cause a disruption or endanger themselves or others if travelling unaccompanied.</p>
<p>We do provide minimum specific assistance services to accommodate customers who need to travel with a suitable trained assistance dog, such as a service dog, partner dog, seeing-eye dog or hearing assistance dog, who require a wheelchair (see <a href="#yakkan5_3">5.3</a>), that have a vision impairment, that have a hearing impairment, that require use of a torso restraint in-flight or that require the use of travel oxygen in-flight. If you need to use these special services please make arrangements through Jetstar.com or the Jetstar Japan Contact Centre. Animals other than a suitable trained assistance dog will not be carried unless required by law. See also clause <a href="#yakkan5_3">5.3</a>.</p>
<p>Accompanying Passenger means a paying Passenger who, in our reasonable opinion, can travel independently and is able to and will provide the appropriate assistance, supervision, or both, as is required for the particular customer they are accompanying. As a guide, Jetstar Japan generally will not consider a passenger to be an appropriate Accompanying Passenger for a child unless the passenger is at least 15 years old.</p>

Flight times do not form part of your contract of carriage with us.</p>
<p>(b) Before we accept your Booking, we or our Authorised Agents will tell you the scheduled departure time of your flight and it will be shown on your Itinerary and Invoice. We may need to change the scheduled departure time of your flight after your Itinerary and Invoice has been issued. If you give us or our Authorised Agents contact information, we or they will try to let you know about any changes.</p>
<p>(c) If, after you pay for your Booking, we make a significant change to the scheduled departure time of your flight or the flight is cancelled (except where this is due to circumstances beyond our control) and:</p>
<ul>
<li>this change means you are unable to use your Booking for its intended purpose, and</li>
<li>we or our Authorised Agents cannot book you on another flight which you are prepared to accept;</li>
</ul>
<p>we will give you a fare refund. Unless otherwise required by law, we will not be responsible for paying any costs or expenses you may incur as a result of the changed time or cancellation.</p>
<h4 class="c6">9.2 Changes due to circumstances beyond our control</h4>
<p>Where a significant delay or cancellation is caused by circumstances beyond our control, including, but not limited to, war, civil disturbance, fire, floods, weather events, acts of God, acts of Government or of any other authorities, accident or failure of machinery or equipment not under Jetstar&rsquo;s custody or control, or industrial action, whether you have checked in or not, Jetstar Japan will get you on the next Jetstar Japan flight with seats available so that you can get to your destination, or we will refund the fare. We will not be responsible for paying any costs or expenses you may incur as a result of the delay or cancellation, unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<h4 class="c6">9.3 No flight connections provided</h4>
<p>Unless you have been advised otherwise by Jetstar Japan, you must collect your Checked Baggage after each individual flight. It is the Passenger&rsquo;s responsibility when making Bookings to allow time for Baggage collection and recheck. Please see jetstar.com for more information.</p>

<h3 class="c5">14. LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE</h3>
<h4 class="c6">14.1 Our Conditions of Carriage</h4>
<p>These Conditions of Carriage govern our liability to you. The liability of any other Carrier involved in your journey will be determined by their own conditions of carriage.</p>
<h4 class="c6">14.2 Our liability for your death, injury or delay</h4>
<p>(a) Japan</p>
<ul>
<li>Where your travel is wholly within Japan with no international sectors, it is subject to the provisions of the Civil Code, the Consumer Contract Act, and other applicable laws in Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) International Carriage</p>
<ul>
<li>For any Damages up to 113,100 SDRs in respect of death or bodily injury caused by an accident on board the aircraft or during embarking or disembarking, we will not exclude or limit our liability. However, any liability we may have for such Damage may be reduced in accordance with applicable law by any negligence on your part that causes or contributes to the Damage.</li>
<li>We will not be liable for Damages in respect of death or bodily injury to the extent that they exceed for each Passenger 113,100 SDRs, if we prove that:<br>
(i) such Damage was not due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of us or our agents, or<br>
(ii) such Damage was solely due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of a third party
</li>
<li>In the case of passenger delay;<br>
(i) where the Warsaw Convention applies, we will be liable for recoverable Damage except when we can prove that we took all necessary measures to avoid the Damage or that it was impossible for us to take such measures,<br>
(ii) where the Montreal Convention applies, we will be liable for recoverable Damage except when we can prove that we took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the Damage or that it was impossible for us to take such measures. Our liability under the Montreal Convention is limited to 4,964 SDR&rsquo;s.</li>
</ul>
<p>(c) European Community</p>
<p>If your Ticket was purchased in the European Community and your travel is from or to a point in the European Community:</p>
<ul>
<li>we will, without delay and in any event not later than 15 days after the identity of the natural person entitled to compensation has been established, make such advance payments as may be required to meet immediate economic needs on a basis proportionate to the hardship suffered,</li>
<li>an advance payment will not be less than the equivalent of 15,000 SDRs per Passenger in the event of the death of a Passenger,</li>
<li>an advance payment does not mean that we admit liability and it may be offset against any subsequent sums paid on the basis of our liability.</li>
</ul>
<p>An advance payment is not returnable unless:</p>
<ul>
<li>we prove that the damage was caused or contributed by negligence of the Passenger or the person who received the payment, or</li>
<li>we prove that the person who received the payment was not entitled to compensation.</li>
