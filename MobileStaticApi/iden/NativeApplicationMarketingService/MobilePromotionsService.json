    "LandingPageText": "<p>When you want to bring more than just your carry-on bags you&rsquo;ll need to pay for checked baggage. Make sure your checked baggage is within size and weight limits so it&rsquo;s safe to fly and understand how to avoid excess baggage charges. <\/p>\u000a<p>The cheapest and fastest way to add checked baggage is to buy when you book. You can add baggage after booking by calling customer service or clicking on the Manage booking tab at Jetstar.com. Baggage added after your initial booking will be charged at a higher rate. <\/p>\u000a<p>At the airport we can&rsquo;t guarantee that we&rsquo;ll be able to add excess baggage to your flight so it&rsquo;s best to add baggage to your booking before you arrive. You&rsquo;ll avoid the higher fees too. <\/p>\u000a<p><sup>#<\/sup>Strict limits apply to carry-on baggage and charges will apply for excess or oversized carry-on baggage.<\/p>",
